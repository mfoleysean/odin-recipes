    <h3>A versatile, classic cocktail</h3>
    <p>The Old Fashioned is a simple mixed drink built upon the minimum requirements of a cocktail dating back to the early 1800s: spirits, bitters, sugar, and water.</p>
    <p>The simplicity of the Old Fashioned enables it to be customized in many ways from using either bourbon or rye whiskeys, or other spirits like rum and brandy. 
        You can also experiment with different bitters, simple syrups, sugar cubes, or maple syrup. 
        You can also try different garnishes for a unique twist such as mulled cherries, cinnamon, vanilla, a mulled orange slice, or an expressed orange peel.</p>
    <p>The following recipe uses bourbon, Angostura bitters, a sugar cube, water, and an orange peel garnish to provide a good starting point before you begin experimenting with your own style of the Old Fashioned.</p>
