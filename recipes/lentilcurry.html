        <h4>Recipe Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large deep skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add the onions, ginger and garlic and saute until fragrant and soft.</li>
            <li>Add the curry paste, turmeric, tomato paste, and salt and pepper, and stir to combine, allowing the mixture to toast slightly over the heat for about one minute. </li>
            <li>Add the carrots, red bell pepper, and lentils and stir to coat in the spice mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour in the vegetable stock and stir well, covering the pan and allowing the mixture to come to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook the lentil mixture for about 20-25 minutes, stirring regularly to prevent the bottom from burning, until the lentils are puffy and soft and begin to lose their shape.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the coconut milk and spinach, stirring just until combined.</li>
            <li>Cover and allow the spinach to wilt for a few minutes in the hot curry.</li>
            <li>Serve over steamed rice with fresh Naan bread, your favourite crusty white bread for dipping, or bakery fresh pita bread as an easy alternative to homemade Naan.</li>
